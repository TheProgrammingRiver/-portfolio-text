<h1>Hi! I am a new software engineer based out of New York.</h1>
 <p>As a former photographer I feel that my creativity will allow me to make new and interesting projects with my programming skills.</p>

<h4>About Me</h4>
<p> After graduating out of high school I moved to California. It's a very lovely place but after a while I ended up coming back in New York to study IT. I enjoyed that job for several years before I ended up leaving it behind to become a photographer, but I think working in software development is my true passion.
